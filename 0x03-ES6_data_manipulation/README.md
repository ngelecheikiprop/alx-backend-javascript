## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- How to use map, filter, and reduce on arrays
- Typed arrays
- The Set, Map, and Weak link data structures

## Requirements

All your files will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x.
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code.
All your files should end with a new line.
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
Your code should use the js extension.
Your code will be tested using Jest and the command `npm run test`.
Your code will be verified against lint using ESLint.
Your code needs to pass all the tests and lint. You can verify the entire project running `npm run full-test`.
All of your functions must be exported.

## Setup

Install NodeJS 12.11.x (in your home directory):

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt install nodejs -y


Verify the installation by checking the versions of NodeJS and npm:

$ nodejs -v
v12.11.1
$ npm -v
6.11.3


Install Jest, Babel, and ESLint in your project directory:

npm install --save-dev jest
npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env
npm install --save-dev eslint


Don't forget to run npm install when you have the package.json file.
